    "Not Like Us" is Artist 1's fourth diss track directed at Artist 2, released on the evening of May 4, 2024, less than 24 hours after the release of "meet the grahams," his third dedicated diss. On the track, Artist 1 avenges the West Coast for Artist 2's controversial use of Artist 3 and Artist 4 A.I. vocals on his song "Taylor Made Freestyle," Artist 2's second diss released via Instagram on April 19. It was removed shortly thereafter because of a cease-and-desist from the estate of the late Artist 3.

Artist 1 raps over a bouncy Artist 5-produced beat which, typical of Artist 5's style, is inspired by hyphy‚Äîa genre of hip-hop popularized in Northern California's Bay Area. In a June 2024 interview with Billboard, Artist 5 revealed that he heard the final mix when the song was released, the beat took him 30 minutes to make, and he talked about the inspiration for his production:

When I was making it, I was, in the back of my head, is: What would Artist 6 do if Artist 7 was in the studio and they was collabin' on the beat? That was my thought process.

Artist 1's zany vocal inflections and fast flows are reminiscent of Bay Area legend Artist 8, a personal favorite of his who was shouted out on October 2012's "Money Trees":

Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do, like rappers do)
Bump that new Artist 8 after school (Way after school, way after school)

Among other disses, notably calling Artist 2 a snitch and culture vulture, Artist 1 doubles down on prior allegations made against Artist 2 of sexual deviancy. This time, he outright uses the term "certified pedophile" as a clever play on Artist 2's September 2021 album, Certified Lover Boy.

The cover art features what appears to be an aerial view of Artist 2's mansion at Park Lane Circle in Toronto, Canada. Park Lane Circle is "a Toronto oasis where celebrities love to build extremely lavish mansions." The thumbnail, edited in a way that closely resembles the sex offender registry which pinpoints convicted offenders' residencies, is continuing the thread of allegations made by Artist 1 that Artist 2 is a sexual predator. It insinuates that Artist 2's mansion, nicknamed "The Embassy," is a hub for illegal sexual activity.

The track was first teased on Twitter by two people: one of Artist 1's associates and Artist 9, founder of TDE, the label and collective that Artist 1 belonged to before launching pgLang. The first tweet stated that "[Artist 1]'s nowhere near done." Artist 9 then posted, "Dot, I see dead people üíÄ" foreshadowing the opening line of the song, which dropped approximately two hours later.

"Not Like Us" became a massively successful hit song both domestically and internationally, breaking several records. On May 7, 2024, it broke the record for most single-day Spotify streams for a hip-hop song in the US, surpassing Artist 2 & Artist 10's September 2021 collaboration, "Girls Want Girls," which hit a peak of 6.6 million. The next day, it was reported to have broken the global record, beating out Artist 2's single-day peak of 11.85 million with September 2021's "Champagne Poetry." On May 13th, Billboard reported that the song would debut at the top of the Hot 100, making it Artist 1's fourth #1 hit and first #1 debut in his home country. It did so with the chart's release the next day, along with the news that it had broken the record for fastest hip-hop song to reach 100 million Spotify streams, surpassing Artist 2's January 2018 single, "God's Plan." May 15 saw the song breaking the record for most Spotify streams in a week in the 2020s, surpassing Artist 11 and Artist 12's "Fortnight" from April 2024.

The first live performance of "Not Like Us" took place at Artist 1's Juneteenth show The Pop Out: Ken & Friends at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California on June 19, 2024. The show was streamed worldwide through Amazon Prime and Artist 1 performed "Not Like Us" multiple times to close the show as the stage filled with fellow West Coast representatives such as Artist 5, Artist 13, Artist 14 and Artist 15 among others. The music video was shot in Artist 1's hometown of Compton, California on June 22 and it premiered on July 4th.`

    title: "Take Me To Church",
    story: `Despite this song's widespread and international success, Artist 1 was a struggling musician when he recorded the song. In fact, it wasn't until the music video‚Äîa critique of Russia's anti-LGBT+ policy which some audiences found controversial‚Äîwent viral that the song attracted attention.

"'Take Me to Church' is essentially about sex," Artist 1 said in an interview with New York Magazine in March 2014, adding that "it's not an attack on faith."

It's about sex and it's about humanity, and obviously sex and humanity are incredibly tied. Sexuality and sexual orientation‚Äîregardless of orientation‚Äîis just natural... The song is about asserting yourself and reclaiming your humanity through an act of love.`

The song talks about trying to preserve their love in a picture so that the romance‚Äôs beauty will remain with them forever.

Ed wrote this song about his ex girlfriend Nina Nesbitt.`
